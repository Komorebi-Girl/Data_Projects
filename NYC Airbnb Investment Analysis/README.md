# NYC Airbnb Investment Analysis

## Description
As a part of this project, I took on the role of a consultant hired by a company to aid their client in analyzing the vacation rental market in New York City. The client is interested in investing in several properties and wants to know which property type would be the best option in terms of revenue generation. My aim was to examine data collected on current Airbnb listings (ex. number of reviews, how many bedrooms/bathrooms, etc) in order to pick out useful insights to guide their decision.

### Ideas for Improvement 
A) I aim to go back and further elaborate on Assumption #3. There is certainly an opportunity to share my research findings which help to explain why I chose the specific benchmarks I did when determining which listings are representative of what an investor would purchase. 

B) I also plan to look into what features and attributes might impact how well a property will perform. Perhaps my investor could charge higher prices as a Superhost or might have a better occupancy rate if they enable "instant booking". Such things are worth delving into when I have some more time to poke around.
