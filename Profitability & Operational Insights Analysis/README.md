# Profitability & Operational Insights Analysis

## Description
For this project, I acted as a consultant for the fictional e-commerce giant, Superstore. My primary objective was to examine their operations to help them increase their profitability and avoid bankruptcy. 

To accomplish this, I broke the overall project into the following stages: 

- Identify Superstore's Profit & Loss Centers -  First, I created visualizations to discover where Superstore is making the most money (so that they can "double-down in these areas/sell more items in those product subcategories, etc) and losing the most money (so they can perhaps discontinue their efforts in these areas and save some funds) <br><br>
- Determine the Value of Advertising -  Next, I wanted to answer the important question: Would it be financially worth it for Superstore to increase their advertising efforts to drum up more profits? And, if so, where should they advertise and when? I <br><br>
- Investigate Returned Items - Last, I endeavored to find out if any products or particular customers have an abnormally high rate of return as frequent returns can easily eat up a significant portion of a company's profits.

The visualizations and insights I produced while going through the above stages can be reviewed at the link below!

### Ideas for Improvement 
A) I want to come back and turn this project into a formal Tableau Story with a more detailed, fluid narrative from start to finish.
