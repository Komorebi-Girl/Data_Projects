# Understanding & Reducing Return Rate Project

## Description
For this project, I was tasked with delivering an analysis to the CEO of the fictional retailer, Superstore. Specifically, The CEO wanted to know the reason for the high number of returned items and requested recommendations on how to reduce the volume of returned orders. 

My first step was to try and find some root causes for the returns. I created a few visualizations to help me investigate the following questions. </br>
1) Is there a clear correlation between sales and returns? Do higher sales mean higher returns?
2) Does the return rate vary by product category?
3) Does the return rate vary by customer? Do certain customers return items at a rate higher than others?
4) Is the return rate higher in certain geographic areas?
5) Is there some sort of seasonal effect to the returns?
6) Is there some combination of these at work?

Next, I made an effort to plan out my dashboard by creating a few pen-and-paper mockups but it proved difficult to squeeze all of the graphs on a single page. I had to pivot to using multiple dashboard pages and building more simplified templates in Tableau. I then filled those templates with all of the visualizations I created. 

The last step was to summarize my findings! I decided to create a Tableau Story and film a 3-5 minute presentation of my analysis. The presentation covers the following: 

1) What I identified as the key root causes of returns
2) An explanation of what is contained in each chart and how the chart should be interpreted
3) An explanation of how to interpret the dashboard pages and how to use filters to identify those same root causes
4) My conclusion and proposed next steps for Superstore
