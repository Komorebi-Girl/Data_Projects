# E-commerce User Activity & Retention Analysis 

## Description
For this project, I took on the role of a junior analyst at a fictional e-commerce company. My first task was to use raw transaction logs to determine how well the company's website was converting product page views into actual purchases by building a conversion funnel. Next, I built acquisition cohorts based on customers' month-of-first-purchase and then calculated the retention rates for each cohort. To wrap everything up, I wrote a short report to present my results and summarize my analysis.

### Ideas for Improvement 
A) I think it could be a good idea for me to go back when I get a chance and add some better formatting (ex. highlighting the columns that contain calculations) to add a tad more usability to the project.
